The {qtexplorer} R package contains a set of charts for investigating QT/ECG cardiac safety, extended from [{safetyCharts}](https://github.com/SafetyGraphics/safetyCharts) pkg. These charts are optimized for usage with the [{safetyGraphics} package](https://safetygraphics.github.io/safetyGraphics/) and shiny application, but can also easily be used as standalone displays.
